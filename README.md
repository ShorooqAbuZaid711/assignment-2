## 🤖 AI Usage Summary

    I used AI tools to support the development process responsibly:
        - ChatGPT → Helped debug CSS layout (flexbox vs. media queries), create a time-based greeting, implement dynamic project search and toggle functionality, and validate contact form inputs.
        - Benefit → Faster problem-solving, clearer understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation, and guidance on interactive feature implementation.
        - Challenge → Needed to carefully review AI suggestions and adapt them to project-specific requirements.
        - Learning Outcome → Improved understanding of responsive design, JavaScript interactivity, and form validation logic.
